Minister Nguyen Ngoc Thien, 

President of Vietnam Olympic Committee, 
asked Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc 
and the National Steering Committee for Covid-19 
Prevention to have Judo, wrestling, gymnastics 
and other athletes vaccinated.

He said this would give them peace of mind 
when competing abroad trying to earn tickets to 
2021 Tokyo Olympics, set to begin July 23 
regardless of the Covid-19 outbreak.
